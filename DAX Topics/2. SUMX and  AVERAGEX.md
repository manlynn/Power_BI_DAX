## When to Use X-Functions vs. Aggregators

You can use X-functions such as SUMX(), and you can also use aggregators such as SUM(), and they do similar things but using different approaches.

#### Example 1 When the Data Doesn't Contain the Line Total

If your Sales table contains a column for quantity (Qty in the image below) and another column for price per unit, then you will necessarily need to multiply the quantity by the price per unit to calculate total sales (because the actual total doesn't exist at the line level).

If this is the structure of your data, then you simply must use SUMX(), like this:
# 
    [Total Sales 1] = SUMX(Sales,Sales[Qty] * Sales[Price Per Unit])
