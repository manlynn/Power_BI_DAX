## Understanding CALCULATE（）

Technically speaking, CALCULATE() alters filter context. It takes an expression (which can be a calculated field or another DAX formula) and modifies that expression by applying new filters. The syntax of CALCULATE() is:

    =CALCULATE(expression, filter 1, filter 2, filter n...)

## Understanding the Flow

*CALCULATE()* alters the filter context coming from the pivot table by using none, one, or more filters prior to evaluating the expression. *CALCULATE()* "reruns" the built-in filter engine in Power Pivot—the one that makes the filters automatically propagate from the lookup tables and flow downhill to the data tables. When the filter engine is rerun by *CALCULATE()*, if there are any filters inside the *CALCULATE()* function, these filters become part of the filter context before the filter engine kicks in.

*CALCULATE()* accepts any number of parameters and the only mandatory one is the fi rst, that is,the expression to evaluate. We call the conditions following the fi rst parameter fi lter arguments. *CALCULATE()* does the following:
 - It takes the current fi lter context and makes a copy of it into a new fi lter context.
 - It evaluates each fi lter argument and produces, for each condition, the list of valid values for that specifi c column.
 - If two or more fi lter arguments affect the same column, they are merged together using an *AND* operator (or, in mathematical terms, using the set intersection).
 - It uses the new condition to replace existing fi lters on the columns in the model. If a column already has a fi lter, then the new fi lter replaces the existing one. If, on the other hand, the column does not have a fi lter, then DAX simply applies the new fi lter to the column.
 - Once the new fi lter context is evaluated, CALCULATE computes the fi rst argument (the expression) in the new fi lter context. At the end, it will restore the original fi lter context, returning the computed result. 

> **Note** CALCULATE does another very important task: it transforms any existing row context
into an equivalent fi lter context.
