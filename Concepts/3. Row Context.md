## Understanding Row Context

A row context is a context that always contains a single row and DAX automatically defines it during the creation of calculated columns. 

When you defined the calculated column, DAX started an iteration from the first row of the table; it created a row context containing that row and evaluated the expression. Then it moved on to the second row and evaluated the expression again.

> Filter Context and Row Context are the only kinds of context in DAX. Any formula will be evaluated under these two distinct contexts.
> We call both contexts “evaluation contexts,” because they are contexts that change the way a formula is evaluated, providing different results for the same formula.

## Understanding What Is Happening

#### 1.What is happening if you define **a calculated column**, in Sales, with this code?
        Sales[SumOfSalesAmount] = SUM ( Sales[SalesAmount] )
> The total of SalesAmount for all the rows, that is, the same value for all the rows.

-   The formula means: “the sum of all sales amount as seen in the current filter context.”
-   As this is in a calculated column, DAX evaluates the formula row by row.
-   So the real question is “What is the current filter context?” 
-   Answer: It is the full database, because **DAX evaluates the formula outside of any pivot table or any other kind of filtering**.
