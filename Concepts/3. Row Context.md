## Understanding Row Context

A row context is a context that always contains a single row and DAX automatically defines it during the creation of calculated columns. 

When you defined the calculated column, DAX started an iteration from the first row of the table; it created a row context containing that row and evaluated the expression. Then it moved on to the second row and evaluated the expression again.

> Filter Context and Row Context are the only kinds of context in DAX. Any formula will be evaluated under these two distinct contexts.
> We call both contexts “evaluation contexts,” because they are contexts that change the way a formula is evaluated, providing different results for the same formula.
