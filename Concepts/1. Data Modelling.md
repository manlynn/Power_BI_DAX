# What is Data Modeling?

Data modelling is the process of taking data from various sources; loading, structuring, and relating data
logically to other data; and enhancing, embellishing, and generally preparing the data for use.
The data modelling process includes:
- Determining the optimal structure and shape of the source data to analyse (e.g., whether to bring in
all the data, full data, or summary data).
- Loading the data from the source into the data model (Power Pivot in this case).
- Defining the logical relationships between the various tables (which is similar to what you do with
VLOOKUP() inside Excel).

- Defining data types (e.g., specifying whether a column of data is numeric or a column of currency
values or a column of text fields).
- Creating new insights from the source data so that you can analyse concepts that don't exist natively
in the source data but yet can be calculated or created inside the data model. For example, if you have
a table of transactional data with cost price and sell price, you can extend the data model to include
a calculation for margin, margin percentage, etc., even though these concepts are not explicitly in
the source data. Once you have modelled these new facts in the data model, they can be reused over
and over by people using your workbook.
