## Understanding Initial Filter Context

The initial filter context comes from four areas of a pivot table:
- Rows (see #1 below)
- Columns (#2)
- Filters (#3)
- Slicers (#4)

## Understanding the Flow of Initial Filter Context

The filters only ever automatically flow from the "one" side of the relationship to the "many" side of the relationship; from the "arrow" side to the "dot" side; from the lookup table to the data tableâ€”whatever terms you use, it's always **downhill**.

## Understanding What is Happening Here

The initial filter context filters the tables in your data model as follows:

1. The initial filter context is applied to the table(s). In this example Products[Category] ="Clothing". The Products table (see #1 below) is then filtered so that only rows in the table that are equal to Clothing remain.
2. This filter automatically propagates through the relationships that exist between the tables, flowing downhill only to the connected table(s) (see #2 below).
3. The connected table (Sales in this example) is then also filtered so that the same products in the Products table will remain in the Sales table (i.e., only clothing products will be visible in the Sales table) (see #3 below).
4. The filter applied to the Sales table does not automatically flow back uphill to the Customers table (or to the other two tables, for that matter) (see #4 below). Filters only automatically propagate through the relationships downhill from the "one" side of the relationship to the "many" side.

So the net result is that the Customers table is completely unfiltered by the initial filter context. Because the Customers table is unfiltered, the total 18,484 is returned to the pivot table in this cell (and the same is true for every other cell for this calculated field in the current pivot).
